This file contains a comparison of different materials and their constants. 
The balls we use to simulate bees in our demo will be made of the material that most closely remsembles the dielectric constant a mason bee could be measured at in the wild, and 
will take the place of a live bee in our demo .
Of course, a higher dielectric constant will lead to higher capacitance/ a higher change in capacitance.

Some research was conducted into finding the dielectric constant of the western honey bees. This research is linked here: [insert link]
Mason bees are roughly the same size as western honeybees and are of similar mass as well. So for our project, we will estimate that a mason bee's body will have a 
dielectric constant of [--------], and can be approximated by a sphere of radius [--------------].
