This file contains a comparison of different materials and their constants. 
The balls we use to simulate bees in our demo will be made of the material that most closely remsembles the dielectric constant a mason bee could be measured at in the wild, and 
will take the place of a live bee in our demo .
Of course, a higher dielectric constant will lead to higher capacitance/ a higher change in capacitance.

Some research was conducted into finding the dielectric constant of the western honey bees. This research is linked here: [insert link]
Mason bees are roughly the same size as western honeybees and are of similar mass as well. So for our project, we will estimate that a mason bee's body will have a 
dielectric constant between 10.32[2] and 10.64 [1].


**a note on the research at Penn State: their methods were also tested on 12-inch diameter conductive spheres, similar to what we intend for our demo.
