This file contains a comparison of different materials and their constants. 
The balls we use to simulate bees in our demo will be made of the material that most closely remsembles the dielectric constant a mason bee could be measured at in the wild, and 
will take the place of a live bee in our demo .
A higher dielectric constant will lead to higher capacitance/ a higher change in capacitance.

Some research was conducted into finding the dielectric constant of the western honey bees. [Refer to source #1 ].
Mason bees are roughly the same size as western honeybees and are of similar mass as well. So for our project, we will estimate that a mason bee's body will have a 
dielectric constant between 10.32[2] and 10.64 [1].

For our demo, we will aim to have spheres that have a radius of 6mm. We require the spheres to be conductive, as bees are made of mostly water, like humans.  

Material      Conductive          Dielectric Constants [3]
Glass            Yes                       min: 3.8 max: 14.5
Steel            Yes                       infinite , as net electric field inside a metal material is zero
Epoxy Resin      No                        min: 3.4 , max: 3.7
Mica             No                        min: 4, max: 9
Slate            No                        min: 7, max: 7
Porcelain        No                        min: 5, max: 6.5


Based on these findings above, we think glass will most closely simulate the presence of a mason bee for our demo purposes.



**a note on the research at Penn State: their methods were tested on 12-inch diameter conductive spheres, similar in concept to what we intend for our demo.
