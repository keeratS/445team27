Lab Work Documentation

April 8, 2022:
Was in lab for about 1.5 hours; worked with Keerat on getting Atmega328 up and running on our laptops based on work Piyush had done. 
Concluded that current system that was setup [ SD card is soldered to headers, and Atmega writes directly to SD Card] will not work for our long term use. 
Decided instead that we would need an SD card reader, so that we may eject SD card from microcontroller board and insert into PCs.
