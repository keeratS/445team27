Lab Work Documentation

April 8, 2022:
Was in lab for about 1.5 hours; worked with Keerat on getting Atmega328 up and running on our laptops based on work Piyush had done. 
Concluded that current system that was setup [ SD card is soldered to headers, and Atmega writes directly to SD Card] will not work for our long term use. 
Decided instead that we would need an SD card reader, so that we may eject SD card from microcontroller board and insert into PCs.

Received the power supplies we had ordered, and tested the method we had learned from online [insert resource here] that
allows us to get both positive and negative voltage for our application/ICs. Confirmed that we can +5 and - 5 out of the power supplies, 
will test it this coming week on our actual circuit.

Worked on SD card reading. There were some initial problems with the Atmega cirucit: it's connection to the crystal oscillator case was incorrect 
[ XTAL1 was  not grounded, XTAL2 was unused, this is not how it is supposed to be], and through some error in disassembling Piyush's original wiring up of the Atmega circuit , 
we messed up the crystal connection. RESET pin [pin 1] also needed to be pulled high using a resistor [ it was connected directly to VCC by me ]. Zadig did not work as intended,
but using "Program using Programmer" combined with selecting a COM port made programmer easy/possible to use. 
MicroSD card module was then connected; microSD card was formatted and then used with adapter/module. Test circuit of connection to microSD card works: "Testing 1,2,3" appears
in a file named TEST on the microSD card. 

Will work in next lab session to read signals from the demodulator.

Tested the first soldered Sensor Board [soldered by Keerat], and found that the output of the demodulator was not at all what was expected. The demodulator chip simply was 
not responding to input from the instrumentation amplifier. Tried to find the issue by checking continuity between joints and found that joints were connected thoroughly. 
All resistors and capacitors were also verified to be soldered on well to the best of our knowledge. Rebuilt the cicrcuit form the PCB onto breadboard to double check PCB
circuit functionality, and saw that everything was working as expected. Decided to solder a new sensor board, got halfway through. Keerat will retouch solder on originally 
soldered sensor board PCB and retest behavior; hopefully this will resolve our issue.
