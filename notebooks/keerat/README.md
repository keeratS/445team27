Spoke to Gregg in machine shop about physical design of bee house.
Covered idea of removable tubes with connector peice to allow us to tinker with positioning as necessary while developing the device.
Discussed dimensions of house (8mm id tubes, square peice 2 in., house itself 5 or 6 across, tubes 5 or 6 deep)
We were advised to look into desired materials and specifics about sensing setup.

Decided on metal balls for bee and parasite simulation for demo because of availability of variety packs of ball bearing sizes.

Pi created CAD files for the physical model of the bee house, I added the capacitor setup that we discussed yesterday.
