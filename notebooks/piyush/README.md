Talked to machine shop about physical design of the bee house, including dimensions, number of tubes and where they would go. 
We decided we would use 8 mm id tubes, and 4 tubes vertically stacked. We were told to come back once we knew what specific materials we wanted.

I created CAD files for the bee house, and keerat added the capacitor setup.

I did the circuit analysis for the first two parts of the circuit (AC bridge and instrumentation amplifier).

We built a circuit for prototyping a very basic version of the capacitance detector on a breadboard.
